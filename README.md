taylor-picketlink-2.0.3
================

This project is a fork of JBoss picketlink federation module version 2.0.3.Final.

In order to support our federation needs, we've added the following new features:

* Secure attribute support.
* Unsolicited SAML 2.0 support.
* SAML Metadata XML Configuration support for service provider.

We've also fixed various bugs discovered during our integration efforts.

We are forking the project for the time being and we will make every effort to submit features,
patches that we create here back to picketlink project in the future.
